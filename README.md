# open_note_auto
This script opens the latest modified notepad in directory you specified for Windows 10.

## Motivation
When I power on laptop for something, I always arrange my shedule day by day on notepad. This program is not heavy and fast, not expensive for space, and enough to write things. Finally, I thought opening itself is comfortable.

## Usage
1. Edit your directory for finding the latest modified file, named DIR in the bat.
2. Check your startup directory
    * windows key + r
    * enter "shell:startup"
    * then explorer will be opened for the directory
3. Move the bat file
